Incredibly easy way to perform **fire-and-forget**, **delayed** and **recurring jobs** inside **ASP.NET applications**. CPU and I/O intensive, long-running and short-running jobs are supported. No Windows Service / Task Scheduler required. Backed by Redis, SQL Server, SQL Azure or MSMQ.

Hangfire provides unified programming model to handle background tasks in a **reliable way** and run them on shared hosting, dedicated hosting or in cloud. You can start with a simple setup and grow computational power for background jobs with time for these scenarios:

- mass notifications/newsletter;
- batch import from xml, csv, json;
- creation of archives;
- firing off web hooks;
- deleting users;
- building different graphs;
- image/video processing;
- purge temporary files;
- recurring automated reports;
- database maintenance;
- *…and so on.*

Hangfire is a .NET Framework alternative to [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), [Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org), [delayed_job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job), [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org).

Installation
-------------

Hangfire is available as a NuGet package. So, you can install it using the NuGet Package Console window:

```
PM> Install-Package Hangfire
```

After install, update your existing [OWIN Startup](http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana/owin-startup-class-detection) file with the following lines of code. If you do not have this class in your project or don't know what is it, please read the [Quick start](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) guide to learn about how to install Hangfire.

```csharp
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
    GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSqlServerStorage("<connection string or its name>");
    
    app.UseHangfireServer();
    app.UseHangfireDashboard();
}
```

Usage
------

This is incomplete list of features, to see all of them, check the [official site](http://hangfire.io) and the [documentation](http://docs.hangfire.io).

[**Fire-and-forget tasks**](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/background-methods/calling-methods-in-background.html)

Enqueued background jobs are being executed inside a dedicated worker pool threads as soon as possible, shortening your request processing time.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Simple!"));
```

[**Delayed tasks**](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/background-methods/calling-methods-with-delay.html)

Scheduled background jobs are being executed only after given amount of time.

```csharp
BackgroundJob.Schedule(() => Console.WriteLine("Reliable!"), TimeSpan.FromDays(7));
```

[**Recurring tasks**](http://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/users-guide/background-methods/performing-recurrent-tasks.html)

Recurring jobs were never been simpler, just call the following method to perform any kind of recurring task using the [CRON expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).

```csharp
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.WriteLine("Transparent!"), Cron.Daily);
```

**Continuations**

Continuations allow you to define complex workflows by chaining multiple background jobs together.

```csharp
var id = BackgroundJob.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, "));
BackgroundJob.ContinueWith(id, () => Console.WriteLine("world!"));
```

**Process them inside a web application…**

You can process background tasks in any OWIN compatible application frameworks, including [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc), [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api), [FubuMvc](http://fubu-project.org), [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org), etc. Forget about [AppDomain unloads, Web Garden & Web Farm issues](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/10/16/the-dangers-of-implementing-recurring-background-tasks-in-asp-net.aspx/) – Hangfire is reliable for web applications from scratch, even on shared hosting.

```csharp
app.UseHangfireServer();
```

**… or anywhere else**

In console application, Windows Service, Azure Worker Role, etc.

```csharp
using (new BackgroundJobServer())
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hangfire Server started. Press ENTER to exit...");
    Console.ReadLine();
}
```

Building the sources
---------------------

To build a solution and get assembly files, just run the following command. All build artifacts, including `*.pdb` files will be placed into the `build` folder. **Before proposing a pull request, please use this command to ensure everything is ok.** Btw, you can execute this command from Package Manager Console window.

```
build
```

To build NuGet packages as well as an archive file, use the `pack` command as shown below. You can find the result files in the `build` folder.

```
build pack
```

To see the full list of avalable commands, pass the `-docs` switch:

```
build -docs
```

Hangfire uses [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) build automation tool. All psake tasks and functions defined in `psake-build.ps1` (for this project) and `psake-common.ps1` (for other Hangfire projects) files. Thanks to the psake project, they are very simple to use and modify!
