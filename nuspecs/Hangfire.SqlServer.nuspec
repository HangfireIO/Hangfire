1.7.13
• Added – `UseIgnoreDupKeyOption` for SQL Server storage configuration (changes to [Set] and [Hash] tables required).
• Fixed – Don't truncate too long keys silently, throw exceptions instead.
• Fixed – Add missing null checks for methods in the `SqlServerWriteOnlyTransaction` class.
• Fixed – Change `holdlock` hint to `xlock` in `merge` statements in transaction to prevent deadlocks.
