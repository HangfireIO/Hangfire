    <description>
      An easy and reliable way to perform fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring long-running, short-running, CPU or I/O intensive tasks inside ASP.NET application. No Windows Service / Task Scheduler required. Even ASP.NET is not required.
      Backed by Redis, SQL Server, SQL Azure or MSMQ. This is a .NET alternative to Sidekiq, Resque and Celery.

1.7.0-beta1

Hangfire.Core

• Added – Support for asynchronous background processes, opens the road toward async storage.
• Added – Circuit breaker pattern for background processes to reduce the logging pressure.
• Added – Processing server is now able to detect it was expired, and restart itself with the new id.
• Added – Ability to use custom delays for automatic retries of a background job.
• Added – ThreadAbortException and ThreadInterruptedException handling to keep the background process running.
• Added – Support for complex Cron expressions, including the `L`, `W`, `#` characters.
• Added – JobActivator.BeginScope method overload with the full PerformContext (by @jeroenvervaeke).
• Added – Support for read-only view for dashboard (by @mikechamberlain).
• Added – Storage property to control the job expiration time (by @rsilvanet).
• Changed – Decrease the size of serialized payloads and remove version information.
• Fixed – Server disappears from the list, but still performing the background processing.
• Fixed – Logging is too aggressive on transient errors.
• Fixed – Confusing Cron scheduling, when both day-of-week and day-of-month fields set.

Hangfire.SqlServer

• Added – Callback method to allow to open the database with impersonation (by @BjoernHund).
• Changed – Identity columns either converted to the `bigint` type, or entirely removed.
• Changed – Clustered indexes were organized according to the access patterns of their tables.
• Changed – Most of secondary indexes were either removed or made filtered.
• Fixed – Background processing stops when identity columns exceed the `Int32.MaxValue`.
• Fixed – Slowdown of scheduled jobs due to the missing index on the [Set] table.
