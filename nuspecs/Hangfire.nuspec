    <description>
An easy and reliable way to perform fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring, long-running, short-running, CPU or I/O intensive tasks inside ASP.NET applications. No Windows Service / Task Scheduler required. Even ASP.NET is not required.
Backed by Redis, SQL Server, SQL Azure or MSMQ. This is a .NET alternative to Sidekiq, Resque and Celery.

• Added – Make it possible to specify multiple `JobContinuationOptions` values for a continuation.
• Added – Ability to use custom formattable resource identifiers for the `DisableConcurrentExecution` filter.

• Added – `IGlobalConfiguration.UseFilterProvider` extension method to unify the configuration.
• Changed – Use the `AttemptsExceededAction.Delete` option by default in the global automatic retry filter.
• Changed – Query time from storage in recurring and delayed schedulers when supported by storage.
• Changed – Increase the default value for the `BackgroundJobServerOptions.StopTimeout` to 500 ms.
• Changed – Speedup delayed jobs when custom default queue is specified by avoiding extra state transition.
• Changed – Move job to the `DeletedState` instead of `SucceededState` when its invocation was canceled by a filter.
• Deprecated – `AddOrUpdate` overloads with optional params defined in the `RecurringJobManagerExtensions` class.
• Deprecated – `AddOrUpdate` overloads with optional parameters defined in the `RecurringJob` class.
• Deprecated – `AddOrUpdate` method overloads with no `recurringJobId` parameter.
• Deprecated – `RecurringJobOptions.QueueName` property, new methods should be used instead.
• Breaking – Dropped `NET45` platform target in favor of `NET451` target to support Visual Studio 2022.

Dashboard UI

• Changed – Improved display of real-time chart with more accents on failed and deleted jobs.
• Changed – Don't display queue name in state transition list when it's the `default` one.
• Changed – Display scheduled job count when enqueued count is zero on the main metric.

Extensibility
• Added – `Factory`, `StateMachine` and `Performer` properties to context classes to avoid injecting services.
• Added – Allow to pass custom data to `ApplyStateContext` and `ElectStateContext` instances.
• Added – Preserve custom data dictionary between the entire filter chain.
• Added – Allow to pass transaction to background job state changer when new methods implemented.
• Changed – Ignore some members when serializing a `JobFilterAttribute` instance to decrease payload size.

Storage
• Added – Virtual `JobStorage.GetReadOnlyConnection` method intended to return `JobStorageConnection` for replicas.
• Added – Virtual `JobStorage.HasFeature` method for querying optional features.
• Added – Optional `GetSetCount` and `GetUtcDateTime` methods for the `JobStorageConnection` class.
• Added – Optional `AcquireDistributedLock` and `RemoveFromQueue` methods for the `JobStorageTransaction` class.
• Added – Support for transactional acknowledge using new storage method for better handling some data loss scenarios.
• Added – `CreateJob` method to the `JobStorageTransaction` abstract class.
• Added – `SetJobParameter` method to the `JobStorageTransaction` abstract class.
